# My Lotr API

My Lotr API is a very simple api that exposes some data from the "Lord of the Rings" universe. This API calls [the One API](https://the-one-api.dev/) to retrieve this data.

The aim of this project is to illustrate some .NET concepts that I talked about in [this blog](https://techwatching.dev).
